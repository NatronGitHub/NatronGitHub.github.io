## Brand

Natron has a logo and you're welcome to use it to identify the program as long as you aren't impersonating the Natron organization or its developers through the use of these assets.  Please review the brief list of guidelines below.

[Click here to download our brand assets!](files/Natron-Brand-Package.zip)

### Please do:

- Use the Natron logo whenever you wish to give credit to the program, when using the logo in film credits please place it with any other relevant logos to ensure it does not imply that your film was created by Natron or its developers
- Try to use the full version of the logo with text wherever space allows
- Use the logo that provides the most contrast against the background it is placed on

### Please do not:

- Attempt to use the Natron logo to pass yourself or organization off as the developers of Natron
- Attempt to use the Natron logo as your own
- Modify the logo in any way

<!-- ### Community Badges

We're borrowing this concept from the Blender Foundation because it's great!  Do you make Natron-related content?  Use these assets to identify it as such!

These badges should not be used to identify Natron in film credits, when crediting the program please use our full logo as distributed in the brand assets package. -->
