An OpenGL 2.0 compatible graphics card is needed to run Natron with hardware accelerated GPU rendering. To run without an OpenGL compatible graphics card you must enable software rendering. On Linux, enable the environment variable LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1 before running Natron. On Windows, enable the legacy hardware package in the installer.

The following graphics cards are supported for hardware-accelerated rendering:

- Intel GMA 3150 (Linux only)
- Intel GMA X3xxx (Linux only)
- Intel GMA X4xxx (Windows & Linux)
- Intel HD (Ironlake) (Windows & Linux)
