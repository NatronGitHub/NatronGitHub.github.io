Natron {{page.version}} is here, bringing Python 3 support, a new CMake-based build system, and an overall improved developer experience!  As with all major releases everything you need to get started can be downloaded [here!](https://natrongitHub.github.io/#download)  Downloads for previous versions can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/NatronGitHub/Natron/releases).

## Major changes

- Use Python 3 rather than Python 2 (which is not maintained anymore). This will require very few changes to the Python code (mainly print statements), and most code can be easily adapted to be 2-3 compatible. #686
- Use [QtPy](https://pypi.org/project/QtPy/)==1.11.2 rather than PySide. QtPy is an abstraction layer for PyQt5/PyQt4/PySide2/PySide (newer versions support PyQt6/PySide6). QtPy uses the Qt5 layout (where the QtGui module has been split into QtGui and QtWidgets). Using QtPy guarantees a higher level of forward-compatibility with future versions of Natron, which may use Qt5 or Qt6. PySide can still be imported explicitly, if required, but the resulting code will not be forward-compatible. Note that 2.4.4 binaries include qtpy, but still import PySide by default. #687

## Known issues

### All operating systems

- Rendering sometimes silently stalls after X frames. #248
- Some image formats may have issues (PCX, PSB). #602
- MTS video files are sometimes not read correctly. #186
