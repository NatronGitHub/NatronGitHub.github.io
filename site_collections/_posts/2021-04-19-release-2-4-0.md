### Plugins

- ReadFFmpeg, WriteFFmpeg: upgrade to work more nicely with the FFmpeg 4 API. #148 #231 #241
- ReadFFmpeg: add support for reading AV1 & Canopus HQ/HQX/Lossless.
- WriteFFmpeg: add support for writing AV1 & Cineform HD.
- Fixed another bug in DenoiseSharpen that caused crash when stoping/aborting. #300
- Fixed Lin2Log to be consistent with Log2Lin. #570
- Merge: never consider RGB as being transparent by default - this is OK for unpremultiplied compositing (After Effects) but is invalid in a premultiplied compositor such as Natron or Nuke. Users still have the option to ignore the alpha channel. #571
- WriteOIIO: Do not add "Color." to the channel names of the color plane (affects mainly OpenEXR). #583
- Writers: when writing RGBA to format that does not support alpha, just drop alpha - don't premultiply. #582
- RGBtoHSL: Fix bug with white and superwhite values. #512
- Reformat: Default to project size. #533
