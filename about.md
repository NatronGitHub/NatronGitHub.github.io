# About

## Software

Natron is a free and open-source compositing suite, geared towards VFX. It is currently actively developed, albeit by a small team of part-time developers.

Please note that Natron is **not**, and will not try to become any of the following things:
- Proprietary commercial or in-house software
- A motion graphics tool like Adobe After Effects
- A full 3D graphics creation suite like Blender
- A non-linear video editor like Premiere Pro
- An amalgamation of professional graphics applications like DaVinci Resolve

We accept feature requests, but please make sure that your feature is realistic and does not ask for the impossible (e.g. "I want Natron to be integrated in Blender").

### Full List of Features

Please note that many features here are experimental, have not received updates for a significant period, and/or require third-party dependencies.

* Cryptomatte
* Importing camera data
* Keyers
* Trackers
* etc.
* Will finish later...

## Development

Natron is currently actively developed, albeit very slowly, because it only has 2 core developers. If you know C++, Qt, and graphics programming, and are interested in Natron, please reach out to us!

## FAQs

**Q: Is Natron free?**

Yes, Natron is free, not only free of cost but also free of user limitations. You are welcome to do (basically) whatever you want with it and the source code.

**Q: Can I sell Natron?**

Yes, as long as you share your copy of Natron under the same license Natron itself uses (which means anyone must have the right to freely view the source code of your product version of Natron). However, we would still advise against selling Natron.

**Q: What can Natron do?**

Natron is specialized around 2D compositing. That means it can:

* Key out green screen
* Rotoscope a moving object or person
* Combine multiple pieces of footage
* Stabilizing footage/tracking
* Adding text and motion graphics to videos
* Warping, cropping, bluring, and color grading footage
* Remove unwanted objects from scenes
* Adjusting rendered OpenEXR files

However, Natron does *not* have 3D compositing features. You are better off using a specialized 3D package like Blender, Maya, Cinema4D, or 3DS Max, or alternatively using a 3D compositor like Nuke.

**Q: Where can I donate to Natron?**

Currently this is being actively dicussed but no unified solution has been reached. Hold on to your donations for now.
