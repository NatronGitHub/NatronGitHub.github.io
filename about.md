# About

![An animated cartoon shot open in Natron](img/about-screenshot.png)

Natron is a free and open-source compositing application geared towards VFX work. It is currently actively developed by a small team of developers as a community effort.

We accept [feature requests and bug reports on GitHub](https://github.com/natronGitHub/natron/issues).

## Development

We regularly accept pull requests and are always looking for new contributors. If you are experienced in C++, Qt, and graphics programming, and are interested in contributing to Natron, please reach out to us!

For instructions on how to build Natron from sources please see [this section of our README document.](https://github.com/NatronGitHub/Natron#building-and-installing-from-source)

## FAQs

### Is Natron free?

Yes, Natron is free and due to its GPL license it always will be.

### What can Natron do?

Natron is suited to perform 2D compositing tasks. That means it can:

* Chromakey blue and green screens
* Rotoscope a moving object or person
* Combine multiple pieces of footage on top of each-other
* Perform 2D stablization and tracking
* Warp, crop, blur, and other effects
* Combine and edit render passes of OpenEXR files

Natron does *not* include 3D compositing features. You will need to use a 3D package like [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) to render your 3D objects before bringing them into Natron for compositing.

### Where can I donate to Natron?

While we appreciate your generosity Natron does not currently accept donations.  Currently all of our contributors have full time jobs and the amount we would likely receive from community donations wouldn't justify the administrative overhead of collecting them.  With that caveat aside, if you are a corporate entity willing to fund development on a larger scale please do reach out!

### Where can I find brand assets for Natron?

You can download our logo and wordmark on our [brand assets page](/brand).
