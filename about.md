# About

![An animated cartoon shot open in Natron](img/about-screenshot.png)

Natron is a free and open-source compositing application geared towards VFX work. It is currently actively developed by a small team of developers as a community effort.

We accept [feature requests and bug reports on GitHub](https://github.com/natronGitHub/natron/issues), but we kindly ask that feature requests be kept to minor improvements at this time.

## Development

We regularly accept pull requests and are always looking for new contributors. If you are experienced in C++, Qt, and graphics programming, and are interested in contributing to Natron, please reach out to us!

For instructions on how to build Natron from sources please see [this section of our README document.](https://github.com/NatronGitHub/Natron#building-and-installing-from-source)

## Brand

Natron has a logo and you're welcome to use it to identify the program as long as you aren't impersonating the Natron organization or its developers through the use of these assets.  Please review the brief list of guidelines below.

[Click here to download our brand assets!](files/Natron-Brand-Package.zip)

### Please do:

- Use the Natron logo whenever you wish to give credit to the program, when using the logo in film credits please place it with any other relevant logos to ensure it does not imply that your film was created by Natron or its developers
- Try to use the full version of the logo with text wherever space allows
- Use the logo that provides the most contrast against the background it is placed on

### Please do not:

- Attempt to use the Natron logo to pass yourself or organization off as the developers of Natron
- Attempt to use the Natron logo as your own
- Modify the logo in any way

<!-- ### Community Badges

We're borrowing this concept from the Blender Foundation because it's great!  Do you make Natron-related content?  Use these assets to identify it as such!

These badges should not be used to identify Natron in film credits, when crediting the program please use our full logo as distributed in the brand assets package. -->

## FAQs

### Is Natron free?

Yes, Natron is free and due to its GPL license it always will be.

### What can Natron do?

Natron is suited to perform 2D compositing tasks. That means it can:

* Chromakey blue and green screens
* Rotoscope a moving object or person
* Combine multiple pieces of footage on top of each-other
* Perform 2D stablization and tracking
* Warp, crop, blur, and other effects
* Combine and edit render passes of OpenEXR files

Natron does *not* include 3D compositing features. You will need to use a 3D package like [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) to render your 3D objects before bringing them into Natron for compositing.

### Where can I donate to Natron?

While we appreciate your generosity Natron does not currently accept donations.  Currently all of our contributors have full time jobs and the amount we would likely receive from community donations wouldn't justify the administrative overhead of collecting them.  With that caveat aside, if you are a corporate entity willing to fund development on a larger scale please do reach out!
