# Getting started

The easiest way to get started is by reading the [official documentation](https://natron.readthedocs.io/en).

While there is not (yet) an official tutorial course for Natron, the videos by [Indie Rebel](https://www.youtube.com/@IndieRebel) and [this tutorial article series](https://openvisualfx.com/2017/07/26/intro-to-compositing-in-natron/) may prove to be helpful.

Additionally, as Natron is very similar to Nuke, reading through the [Nuke documentation](https://learn.foundry.com/nuke/13.0/content/learn_nuke.html) (ignoring any 3D compositing parts) is a good way to get started too.
